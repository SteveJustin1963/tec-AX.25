### AX.25

Amateur X.25 is a data link layer protocol originally derived from layer 2 of the X. 25 protocol suite and designed for use by amateur radio operators. It is used extensively on amateur packet radio networks. How does AX 25 work? AX. 25 supports both virtual-circuit connected and datagram-style connectionless modes of operation. The latter is used to great effect by the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS). A simple source routing mechanism using digipeaters is available at the datalink level.

### KISS protocol? 
KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) is a protocol for communicating with a serial terminal node controller (TNC) device used for amateur radio. This allows the TNC to combine more features into a single device and standardizes communications. KISS was developed by Mike Cheponis and Phil Karn to allow transmission of AX.

### APRS
Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) is an amateur radio-based system for real time digital communications of information of immediate value in the local area. Data can include object Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates, weather station telemetry, text messages, announcements, queries, and other telemetry. Does APRS work without internet? No! But interfacing with APRS-IS (internet service) will expand on its usage, including: Plotting of positions on online maps; Message exchange to stations outside of local RF/digipeater coverage (using internet as a relay to RF in other locations);

### TNC
A terminal node controller (TNC) is a device used by amateur radio operators to participate in AX. 25 packet radio networks. It is similar in function to the Packet Assembler/Disassemblers used on X. 25 networks, with the addition of a modem to convert baseband digital signals to audio tones.

### Digicom-C64
Digicom Packet Radio with AM7910 Modem is a modem designed for use with the Commodore 64 home computer. It was manufactured by Digicom Electronics, and released in 1985. The modem connects to the Commodore 64's user port and provides an RS-232 interface. It supports data rates of 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, and 19200 baud. 
The modem was designed for use with the Digicom Packet Radio Terminal Program, which was included on a ROM cartridge that plugged into the Commodore 64's cartridge port. The program allowed the user to connect to packet radio networks and exchange data with other users. The modem was also compatible with other Commodore 64 software programs that supported RS-232, such as terminal programs and bulletin board systems. The modem was sold with a one-year warranty and retailed for $349.95.
