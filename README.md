tec1 and radio AX.25

Amateur X.25 is a data link layer protocol originally derived from layer 2 of the X. 25 protocol suite and designed for use by amateur radio operators. It is used extensively on amateur packet radio networks. How does AX 25 work? AX. 25 supports both virtual-circuit connected and datagram-style connectionless modes of operation. The latter is used to great effect by the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS). A simple source routing mechanism using digipeaters is available at the datalink level.

What is KISS protocol? KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) is a protocol for communicating with a serial terminal node controller (TNC) device used for amateur radio. This allows the TNC to combine more features into a single device and standardizes communications. KISS was developed by Mike Cheponis and Phil Karn to allow transmission of AX.

What is Ham radio APRS? Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) is an amateur radio-based system for real time digital communications of information of immediate value in the local area. Data can include object Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates, weather station telemetry, text messages, announcements, queries, and other telemetry. Does APRS work without internet? No! But interfacing with APRS-IS (internet service) will expand on its usage, including: Plotting of positions on online maps; Message exchange to stations outside of local RF/digipeater coverage (using internet as a relay to RF in other locations);

What is a ham radio TNC? A terminal node controller (TNC) is a device used by amateur radio operators to participate in AX. 25 packet radio networks. It is similar in function to the Packet Assembler/Disassemblers used on X. 25 networks, with the addition of a modem to convert baseband digital signals to audio tones.
